# Array

- The collection of data is stored in contiguous memory.(i.e. if the first element is 'a' and stored in 1928 locaton the second element will be stored in 1929)
- Basic Arrays were generally static in size due to the contiguous memory concept.
- Accessing an elemen at index is quite simple , we first get the index of first element and now add the multiplication of index and type size (i.e. for char array it will be 2 , for int array it will be 2/4).
- Adding or delete is quite complex as we have to maintain the contiguous memory concept.
- Most modern languages made array dynamic in size and did adding , deleting simple or gave new concept like vectors(dynamic arrays)
