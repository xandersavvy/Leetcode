# Linked list

- A linked list generally has two nodes  , First one contains data and second one points to the address of the data of the next node.
- Not contiguous memory needed , so, generally dynamic in nature.
- As we declare the address of the next node , inserting and deleting is quite easy.
- For accessing element at random locations , wer have to always read the list from front toget the address , so , it is quite inefficient in this regard.
