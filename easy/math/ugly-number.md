# Ugly Number

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

## Example 1:

    Input: n = 6
    Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
## Example 2:

    Input: n = 1
    Output: true

Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
## Example 3:

    Input: n = 14
    Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

## Constraints:

    -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

# Solutions

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int n) {
        int arr[3]={2,3,5};
        
        for (int i:arr) while((n%i==0)&&n) n/=i;
        
        return n == 1;
    }
};
