This is a simple challenge to help you practice printing to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29) . You may also want to complete Solve Me First in C++ before attempting this challenge.
We're starting out by printing the most famous computing phrase of all time! In the editor below, use either [printf](http://www.cplusplus.com/printf) or [cout](http://www.cplusplus.com/cout) to print the string **Hello, World!** to [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_.28stdout.29).

The more popular command form is cout. It has the following basic form:

    cout<<value_to_print<<value_to_print;

Any number of values can be printed using one command as shown.

The printf command comes from C language. It accepts an optional format specification and a list of variables. Two examples for printing a string are:

    printf("%s", string); printf(string);

Note that neither method adds a newline. It only prints what you tell it to.

Output Format

    Print Hello, World! to stdout


Sample Output

    Hello, World!
